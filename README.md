# ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Prediction
A machine learning project to predict whether a tumor is **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using features from a breast cancer dataset.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a classification model that can **accurately predict the nature of a tumor** (malignant or benign) based on various medical measurements.

## Project Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**

   * Used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset

2. **Explore the Dataset**

   * Checked shape, types, and class distribution

3. **Clean the Data**

   * Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values

4. **Visualize the Data**

   * Explored correlations and feature distributions

5. **Preprocess the Data**

   * Encoded labels and normalized features

6. **Train a Model**

   * Applied classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

7. **Evaluate the Model**

   * Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## âœ… Results

* Achieved high accuracy on validation data
* Random Forest showed the best performance
* Key features influencing prediction were radius mean, texture mean, and concavity mean
